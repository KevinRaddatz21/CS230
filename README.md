(1) Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room is a company that offer games to their clients (currently only on android devices). The Gaming room wanted a cross-platform version of their game 
draw it or lose it that could be be played inside a modern web browser.

(2) What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I thought I did a good job of keeping the format together of the document and catching a basic idea of the clients requirements. There is however a LOT of room
for improvement. 

(3)What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

It was helpful to see an overview of the entire requirements for the software in one place. It was also helpful to see these requirements alongside a UML diagram so that I was able to see how things all fit together a bit better. 

(4)If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

There is so much that I could and would change about this document. If I had to pick just one thing, it would be the depth of what I put into it. There is a lot of parts of the document where I didn't offer enough detail or was kind of barking up the wrong tree. I would be a bit more careful of the path that I was taking as well as adding more description/detail to the document (Mainly in the evaluation) while I could have done a better job describing the domain model. 

(5)How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I was sure to CAREFULLY read the initial instructions from the client over and over again to make sure that I fully understood them. It is critical to fully understand the client's requirements to be able to transform them into a software design or in the end an actual piece of code. It is also critical to understand the user experience of the software. If the user's needs aren't considered, you could end up with a piece of code that is completely unfunctional for an end user trying to use the software. 

(6)How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I approached designing software by doing it one small piece at a time. In the future, I would change this approach slightly and first have a big picture focus of designing the application before I then focus in on the smaller details.
